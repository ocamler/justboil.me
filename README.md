Forked Version README
=====================

The goals of this fork are:

 * Add new 'max\_viewer\_width' and 'max\_viewer\_height' config.php options that will set the default max width/height of the uploaded image in the TinyMCE editor, but *won't* alter the original image file. \[**DONE**\]
 * Provide a drag-n-drop target for files in the popup window (TinyMCE version 4 *only*). \[**DONE**\]
 * Allow multiple files to be uploaded at once (TinyMCE version 4 *only*, and contingent on the max\_file\_uploads specified in php.ini). \[**DONE**\]

Fork README
===========

The goals of this fork are twofold:

 * Add new 'max\_viewer\_width' and 'max\_viewer\_height' config.php options that will set the default max width/height of the uploaded image in the TinyMCE editor, but *won't* alter the original image file. \[*DONE*\]
 * Provide a drag-n-drop target for files in the popup window.
